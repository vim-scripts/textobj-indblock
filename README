The textobj-indblock plugin provides text objects to select a block of indentation whitespace based on the indentation of the current line.

This plugin supplements, and in this respect closely follows the example of the textobj-indent plugin (vimscript #2484).

See the documentation there to learn more.

This plugin depends on the framework provided by the textobj-user plugin, version 0.4.0 (vimscript #2100).
